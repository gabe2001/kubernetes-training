### LAB 6 - Storage in PODS
###

1. Creating storage shared between containers in PODS - MTDIR volumes

Create the following POD with one container named my-container running alpine


kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: simple-volume-pod
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: simple-vol
    emptyDir: {}
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    volumeMounts:
      - name: simple-vol
        mountPath: /var/simple
    image: alpine
    command: ["/bin/sh"]
    args: ["-c", "while true; do date >> /var/simple/index.html; sleep 2; done"]

2. Check with kubectl exec inside the PODs container to see what happens on the /var/simple filesystem.

3. Extend the POD to include one more container. This container should be called my-web and running the
   nginx:1.7.1 image. Ensure that this PODs mounts the volume provided by emptyDir on /usr/share/nginx/html.

4. Check using http (e.g. curl, links) from outside if you can see the index.html file.
